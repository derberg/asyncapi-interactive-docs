To generate your code you'll use the [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) Node.js template.

# Generating code

1. Install the generator to use is at a command-line tool: `npm install -g @asyncapi/generator`{{execute}}

1. Trigger generation of the Node.js code: `ag asyncapi.yaml @asyncapi/nodejs-template -o output -p server=mosquitto`{{execute}}

1. And voil√†! In the editor you can see a new folder is created with generated Node.js application. Enter the folder in the terminal: `cd output`{{execute}}

# Running your code

1. Install dependencies of newly generated application: `npm install`{{execute}}
1. Start the application: `npm start`{{execute}}
1. In another terminal install the MQTT.js library: `npm install mqtt -g`{{execute}}
1. Send message to your application: `mqtt pub -t 'light/measured' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m '{"id": 1, "lumens": 3, "sentAt": "2017-06-07T12:34:32.000Z"}'`{{execute}}   
1. Go back to previous terminal and notice that your application logs the message you just sent.

# Conclusions

You've learned how to create an AsyncAPI description file and how to generate code from it. The code is a bootstrap and you'll need to add your business logic into it. Take some time to play with it.
There are still lots of things to be covered but intent of this tutorial is to be simple so you get an idea of the potential.

We would also like to see what you create with AsyncAPI. As an open-source project, we're open to proposals, questions, suggestions, and contributions. If you don't feel in the mood to contribute but you're using AsyncAPI, just raise your hand [creating a issue in our Github repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/issues/new) or [join our Slack channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/). Don't be shy :)
